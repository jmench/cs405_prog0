# CS405 Program 0 #
## Author: Jordan Menchen ##
### Description: ###
This program will search through two given .txt files and output the names and
salaries of employees that match the city entered by the user on the command
line.

### How to Run: ###
You can run the program with the command `java prog0.java CITYNAME` where
`CITYNAME` is the city you'd like to search (ex. `java prog0 Louisville`).

The program may take a few seconds to run, so be patient. The output will be a
list of names and salaries in the format **NAME:SALARY**.

### IMPORTANT ###
Please note that the program will not compile/run without the text files in the
same directory as the *prog0.java* file. These files **MUST** have the names
*personnel_addresses.txt* and *personnel_salaries.txt* and **MUST** have the
formats **NAME|CITY** and **NAME|SALARY** respectively.
